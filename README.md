# google-quickdraw-classification
The purpose of this project is to design a machine learning algorithm that can automatically identify hand drawn images as well as reason about their appearance, thus allowing automatic classification of the hand drawn images into one of the 31 classes. The hand drawn images are an extract from Googles Quick Draw Dataset. Performance is then compared to other participants in a Kaggle-based competition.
